## What it does

- **Search in your language, read in any language.**  
  Type a query (e.g., “Stock Market”) and the app finds relevant news across locales.
- **Short, readable summaries.**  
  Each result includes a 2–5 sentence extractive brief.
- **Language filter.**  
  Narrow results to a specific language when you want.

**Supported languages:** EN, FR, ES, DE, IT, PT, HI, JA

## How it works (in brief)

- **Semantic retrieval:** Uses multilingual SBERT (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) to embed headlines/descriptions and rank results by cosine similarity.
- **Summarization:** Builds a sentence-similarity graph and selects central sentences (TextRank-style) for a compact summary.
- **Feeds:** Pulls public Google News RSS for multiple locales and topics, dedupes near-duplicates, and caches embeddings for fast queries.

## Why it’s useful

- Cut through duplicate headlines across outlets/countries.
- Discover coverage outside your default locale.
- Skim summaries to decide what’s worth a full read.

## Notes & Limits

- **Cold start:** If the API was idle, your first search may take a few seconds while it “warms up.” Try again if needed.
- **Source links:** Click a card’s title to read the full article on the publisher’s site.
- **Privacy:** No accounts. Queries are sent to the hosted API only to compute results; no personal data is stored.
